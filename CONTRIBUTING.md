# How to contribute

First off, thank you for showing interesting in contributing to this project! This document has the necessary information to help you push your contributions easily.

## Environment
The development environment is described in project's [README](README.md) file. Apart from that, there is no code for development tools and environment; you may use whatever suits you the best.

## Naming conventions
Classes, IDs, and SCSS variable names are in [Kebab case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Kebab_case) style. In case this is new to you, it is basically Snake case, but with lines (-) instead of underscores (_). One example is `main-section-header`.

## Submitting changes
The preferred way of submitting changes is by sending a pull request. I will check PRs as soon as I possibly can.
